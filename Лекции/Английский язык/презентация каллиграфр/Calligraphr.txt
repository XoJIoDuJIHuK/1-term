Today i want to introduce you a very helpful service for lazy students - Calligraphr. This service allows you to create
your own font and use it. This opens up a lot of possibilities, for example you may type your studying notes on your
laptop or phone and then print it in a copybook, and when time to submit for check comes you will have full notes
without lots of hand work. Also you may make cheat sheets look like they were written by hand.So, to create your own
font, you have to create a template which contains neccessary literals, print it, fill every cell by hand, scan it 
and download font file. But life is cruel, so you may create a template with only 70 literals without subscription,
which makes it less comfortable
